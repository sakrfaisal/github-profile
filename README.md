### What I learned

I have learned how to use the GitHub API to fetch user data and display it in a user-friendly format. I also improved my skills in React and css, particularly in creating responsive layouts and handling asynchronous data fetching.

### Useful resources

- [GitHub API Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) - This helped me understand how to interact with the GitHub API effectively.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- api.github.com - GitHub API for fetching user data

## Features

- search for GitHub users
- show results for the search query
- display user information such as avatar, name, bio, location, and repositories
- responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
